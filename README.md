# IoT-Based-Smart-Irrigation-and-Soil-Monitoring-System-for-Crop-Specific-Water-Management
This project uses IoT to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and humidity and automatically control irrigation based on crop needs. Sensor data is sent to a cloud platform for real-time monitoring, reducing water wastage and improving crop productivity through smart irrigation.
